# Mpharma Developer test | Emerald Kwekowe

Built with React, styled with custom css & sass.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install packages

### `npm start`

To start the app in dev mode

### `npm test`

Launch the test runner. Currently only one unit test is setup for the custom `<img>` component: `Image`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.


### Notes
- State was normalized manually.
- In case of any confusion, products and prices are ordered in descending `id` and `array index`  order as more recent items are added at the end of the array giving them a higher index value and id.
- Click on the `reset state` button at the bottom left to set the state back to initilization. 
- I am availble for any clarifications
